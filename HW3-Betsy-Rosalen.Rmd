# Normal Approximation to the Binomial
mu <- 151 * .09
v <- mu * (1-.09)
s <- sqrt(v)
z = (11-13.59)/s
round(z,2) # when I look up this z score I get a probabiliy of .23 
# not sure why the formula below does not give me the same...
round(pnorm(10.5, mean=mu, sd=s),4)

# When I use 11 it comes out spot on, but the textbook says to go .5 over your  
# highest number and .5 below your lowest when you are using the normal  
# distribution to approximate the binomial...
round(pnorm(11, mean=mu, sd=s),4)
```
